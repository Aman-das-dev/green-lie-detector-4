Green Lie Detector


A web application that analyzes sustainability claims to determine if they are "structurally honest" or "green lies" that unfairly shift responsibility without providing the necessary power to act.

🌍 Overview
The Green Lie Detector evaluates environmental and sustainability statements by assessing whether the target group (youth, consumers, governments, etc.) actually has the structural power to implement the requested changes. It examines five key criteria:

Decision Authority: Can the target group make this decision?
Access to Alternatives: Are sustainable options available and convenient?
Affordability: Can the target group afford to take action?
Infrastructure Availability: Does the necessary infrastructure exist?
Enforcement Power: Can the target group enforce systemic change?
✨ Features
Statement Analysis: Analyze predefined sustainability claims or input custom statements
Interactive Evaluation: Step-by-step assessment of structural conditions
Verdict System: Determines if statements are structurally honest, partially valid, or structurally dishonest
Actionable Suggestions: Provides specific recommendations to make dishonest statements honest
Pattern Insights: View analysis patterns across different types of green messaging
Youth-Focused: Built for youth leadership in sustainability discourse

📖 Usage
Analyzing a Statement
Choose Input Method:

Predefined Patterns: Select from curated examples of common green messaging
Custom Statement: Paste your own sustainability claim to analyze
Provide Context:

Statement source (Corporate, Government, Campaign, etc.)
Target group (Youth, Consumers, General Public, etc.)
Evaluate Conditions:

Review each of the 5 structural criteria
Assess availability for the target group
Get real-time feedback on your evaluations
View Results:

See the structural verdict
Understand missing conditions
Get actionable suggestions to make the statement honest
Understanding Verdicts
Structurally Honest: All necessary conditions are available to the target group
Partially Valid: Some conditions are missing but the statement isn't fully dishonest
Structurally Dishonest: Multiple key conditions are missing, creating false accountability
🔍 How It Works
The evaluation engine uses a structural power analysis framework:

Target Group Assessment: Determines typical power levels for different groups (governments have high power, youth have low power)

Condition Evaluation: Checks each criterion based on:

The target group's structural position
Keywords in the statement text
Source type of the claim
Dynamic Verdict Calculation: Combines missing conditions to determine overall structural honesty

Actionable Suggestions: Generates specific recommendations to address missing conditions

📊 Data Sources
The application includes a curated dataset of sustainability statements (lib/green-lie-facts.json) covering various sources and target groups. This data helps identify patterns in green messaging and provides examples for analysis.

🎯 Mission
Built for youth leadership in sustainability discourse, this tool exposes structural dishonesty in environmental messaging. By analyzing who has the power to create change versus who is being asked to change, it promotes more effective and equitable sustainability communication.
